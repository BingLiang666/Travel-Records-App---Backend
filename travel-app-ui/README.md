# Travel Records Management Platform (Frontend)

## Description
This repo contains frontend UI for the management of travel records.

We sometimes forget those wonderful travels we had with our families, friends, or just ourselves. Does it sound nice if we can have a tool that helps us 
manage all the travel records which we can edit and review at any time or even share with others?

“Travel Records Management Platform” is such a tool built with web application techniques, i.e., FastAPI and SQLite, where users can manage their travel 
records easily. They can create new travel records or update the existing records within only a few minutes, and retrieve those records with just a few 
clicks.
